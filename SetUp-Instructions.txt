1- Install Strawberry Perl:

   - Double-click strawberry-perl-5.10.1.0. msi to run the installation.

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install in the default folder.

Note: Installing Strawberry Perl modifies the system’s PATH environment variable, and adds the Strawberry Perl folder, for example, C:\strawberry\perl\bin. This is required for Web Tours to operate properly.

2- Install Web Tours: Unzip the contents of the WebTours. zip to a folder on the machine, for example to C:\WebTours. 


3- Start Web Tours:
Access the folder where you have unzipped WebTours. zip, for example C:\WebTours.

Run StartServer. bat.

A standard command line window opens, indicating that the server is running. Keep this window open while you access the Web Tours application.

4- Access through Browser :
	Go to address bar and type this url:
	http://localhost:1080/WebTours/  or http://127.0.0.1:1080/WebTours
